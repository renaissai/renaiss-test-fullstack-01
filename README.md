# Description

The objective of the exercise is to evaluate the programming skills and the approach to solving the presented problem. For this, we propose creating a microservice usign FastAPI and a small frotend in React.

Good luck!

# Exercise


## Poblem
---
A microservice is required to be created with login functionality and user registration, with access to a chat and a language model for chat history. The project must be developed using the following technologies:

- Frontend in Next.js or Native JS
- Free Frontend styles/components, but preferably using flowbite, styled components or tailwind
- Backend in FastAPI
- Relational database (your choice)
- Queues (optional)
- Dockerized
- Authentication will be done through the use of JWT from the frontend. Chats will be saved in the style of chatgpt, allowing to start a chat from scratch.

## Evaluation
----
The evaluation process will focus on the following aspects:

- Application functionality
- Performance and optimization of multiple requests
- Microservices architecture
- Code readability and project organization
- Logic and problem-solving
- The candidate's ability to create a scalable architecture, as well as their skill in optimizing application performance, will be valued. Their ability to organize code and effectively solve problems will also be taken into account.
